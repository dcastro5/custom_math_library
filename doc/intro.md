# Introduction to Cutsom Math Library for Clojure:

Functions:

-clear: takes no parameters, clears screen in 24-line terminal window; created for REPL use

-dr: takes 1 number as a parameter, returns the radian equivalent for the supplied degree value

-rd: takes 1 number as a parameter, returns the degree equivalent for the supplied radian value

-sind: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), and returns sin x where x is a degree measure

-cosd: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), and returns cos x where x is a degree measure

-tand: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), and returns tan x where x is a degree measure

-asind: takes 1 number as a parameter, performs the arcsine function on said number and returns the result in degrees

-acosd: takes 1 number as a parameter, performs the arccosine function on said number and returns the result in degrees

-atand: takes 1 number as a parameter, performs the arctangent function on said number and returns the result in degrees

-csec: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns cosecant x where x is a radian measure

-seca: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns secant x where x is a radian measure

-ctan: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns cotangent x where x is a radian measure

-csecd: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns cosecant x where x is a degree measure

-secad: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns secant x where x is a degree measure

-ctand: takes 1 number as a parameter (x), returns cotangent x where x is a degree measure

-geomean: takes 2 numbers as parameters, returns the geometric mean of the numbers
